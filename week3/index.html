        <p><em>Questions</em></p>
        <ul class="questions">
            <li class="question">is there a use case that makes sense for the double click event listener on a website? I know it works for opening software on my computer, but usually a single click activates a function like clicking a link or button.</li>
            
        </ul>
        <p>Honestly I was having some trouble finding a direct answer to my question. I mostly found information for the syntax of the double click event, but not much about what it is actually good for. Because of this, I went back to the book and re-read the example they used for it. applying a "highlight" to an element that is double clicked seems like a good use case, especially for something like an online text book. You could mark a whole paragraph by double clicking it. In thinking about this further, I wondered if there would be a way to double click a paragraph in order to apply focus and select it, making it easy to copy and paste a paragraph. I was able to find <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/985272/selecting-text-in-an-element-akin-to-highlighting-with-your-mouse">this article</a> that shows a vanilla javascript method for selecting text in a node. I could use a double click event listener to try out my use case with this syntax. I will make this an exercise for an upcoming week.</p>
        <p>I ended up pushing the "view more" cards to next week to explore using Maps which I hadn't used before and to practice using querySelectors on the DOM. in the Cipher / decoder exercise.</p>
        <p>I learned a lot from using queryselectors to target DOM nodes in the decoder self-assigned exercise. I tried out targeting direct child nodes and globally selecting child nodes. Some more notes have been inserted in console.log statements in the exercise page above.</p>
