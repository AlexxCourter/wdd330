        <h2>Milestones toward discovering gifts and developing talents:</h2>
        <p>Take a moment to be grateful for the gifts you know you have. Your life, your health, good friends, good family, whatever it is.</p>
        <p>Reflect on the things you have valued in your experience. Was there anything you did well at that you haven't done in a while? Was there some interest you had, like art or music, that you haven't tried yet?</p>
        <p>Discover your talents, then work harder, smarter, and faster to grow them.</p>
        <p>Work harder at your talent by establishing a daily practice or regular discipline.</p>
        <p>Work smarter and faster at your talent by finding role models and a mentor.</p>
        <p>Don't compare yourself to ANYONE except the person that you were yesterday.</p>
